## Introduction

LinkedIn, the supposed networking haven for professionals promising career opportunities and connections. Little did I know that when I jumped into the tech world and corporate dreams, I'd find myself stuck in its web. You see, I'm usually the type to shy away from centralized platforms and social media, preferring the shadows over the spotlight. But the demands of a tech job left me no choice but to dive into the LinkedIn abyss.

LinkedIn seemed like a necessary evil I had to hug, but beneath its shiny surface lies a world of frustration and annoyance that I just can't keep quiet about.

### **The Illusion of Professionalism**:

LinkedIn loves to brag about being the pinnacle of professionalism. However, the reality often feels like a show. Shiny profiles with buzzwords and exaggerated job titles make it seem like everyone is a CEO, even if it's just a one-person operation. This self-aggrandizement leads to the culture of comparison. As you scroll through profiles boasting achievements and titles, the seeds of self-doubt are planted. LinkedIn thrives on the 'fake it till you make it' philosophy, with people exaggerating achievements and turning their profiles into works of fiction. Can we please bring back honesty and authenticity? In my quest for a job, I've realized one thing: in the corporate world, you've got to present yourself in a way that doesn't entirely reflect who you are to make it through.

### **Mandatory Activity for Job Seekers**:

"You must become a LinkedIn aficionado to land a tech job ðŸ¤“." The pressure to post updates, share articles, and comment on everything under the sun, all in the name of "building your personal brand." Can't I just be judged on my skills and/or experience? Some folks, like myself, prefer to keep personal details, achievements, and experiences private.

### **The Endorsement Dilemma**:

The virtual pats on the back. As meaningful as a participation certificate. The endorsement system feels more like a popularity contest than a genuine reflection of one's abilities.

## Conclusion

So in conclusion since you like rappers that's killing that pussy, I'm killing myself.
